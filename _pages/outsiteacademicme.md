I'm proud to be a Vietnamese, a girl being raised in the beautiful and historic capital city, in a traditional and well-educated family. I am a big fan of travelling and new experiences. I have been to more than 25 countries and still counting. I hope that soon in the next few years, I could go nearer to the North Pole and experience the coldness there.  

Apart from doing math and teaching, I enjoy cooking and can spend hours in the kitchen. I feel very relaxed when I cook. I am very good at tasting the food one time and duplicating the dish. I usually cook Asian food and sometimes Western cuisine. I normally do baking on my family member's birthday or on some special occasions and I think it always tastes good (since my family usually eat the whole cake without any leftover).  

I have played the piano since I was 7 years old, and I can play quite well. I love classical music and going to music concerts, which was inspired by my father - the one who taught me how to play the piano for the first time. 

Although nowadays, people usually video everything in life and do short contents, I prefer writing. I have run a small blog for 8 years where I write very often about everything happening in my life such as my travelling, lessons I leart from my work, my good and bad experience or just like a diary during big occasion that I want to keep memory. I am also building a blog with my friend where we would like to share the beauty of mathematics and skills as a researcher.
